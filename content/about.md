hi. Oyyko here.

One of my favorite Latin aphorisms is: "Memento mori". It means remember you are mortal.

Below is an introduction to this blog. If you want to see my profile, please see https://oyyko.com/.
 
The "Archive" page shows all posts in chronological order.

The "Tags" page shows all tags.

The "About" page, as you can see, is an introduction to this website.

The ":Life" page includes articles which records my thinking in daily life and is more personal.

The ":Coding" page includes articles that are more code-oriented and technical, such as algorithm puzzles, IDE usage tips, environment configuration, and these posts are more practical, maybe not containing deep ideas but just some tips for using tools like complier or programming languages.

The ":Study" page includes articles that are more abstract and profound. Such as incomprehensible concepts in programming languages, pros and cons between languages, compiler implementations, concepts in advanced mathematics, and the analysis of operating system principles. These are more esoteric and worth reading. In contrast, the :Coding page is more of a personal note.

:Coding articles are written for convenience. The purpose of writing :Study articles is to record and inspire thinking. The reader of the former is assumed to be myself, the reader of the latter is assumed to be you.
